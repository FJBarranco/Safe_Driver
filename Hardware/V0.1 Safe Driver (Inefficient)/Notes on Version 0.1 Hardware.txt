The hardware used on prototype V0.1 is very inefficient as it uses relays to control 12v hardware. 
The Casing is big and bulky making it hard to drive with or connect to the obd port.
Future idea for V0.2 includes using transistores only as a method od reducing engine power by disconnecting injectors on vehicle.
